# CollectionModel
A challenge to model a collection of people
Write code that models (in other words, represents) a collection of people (E.g., a club, class, or company). The code you write should be clean, simple, and reusable.

Each person in the set of people has 2 properties:
A name
An age

You may initialise the collection with 4 hard coded users:
Alice, age 20
Bob, age 25
Carol, age 30
Dave, age 35

Your code should calculate and output:
The average age
The oldest person in the collection
The youngest person in the collection


Part B
Create a user interface - console based or GUI - that presents the data modeled above. If implementing a graphical user interface (such as a mobile app, web application or desktop GUI), you may want to consider an appropriate layout that presents the data in a sensible way. Your solution should include any relevant source files - such as layout XML files, HTML or CSS.

Your application will need to store the data in memory. However, If you choose to use a database to write the data out to permanent storage, remember to include any files necessary to initialise the database (migrations / seeders etc).

Your user interface should consist of 2 types of page:

Page 1 - Details the collection as a whole (I.e., lists all users, and the data listed above in 1 - 3).
Page 2 - Detail page for an individual user.


Extension:

Implement a form to enable a new user - Eve, age 40 to be added to the group. Once added, your code will automatically recalculate & re-generate the output (1-3).
